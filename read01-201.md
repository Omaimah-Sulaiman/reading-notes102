# what is HTML?

## HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is a simple markup system used to create hypertext documents that are portable from one platform to another. HTML documents are SGML documents with generic semantics that are appropriate for representing information from a wide range of applications. HTML markup can represent hypertext news, mail, documentation, and hypermedia; menus of options; database query results; simple structured documents with in-lined graphics; and hypertext views of existing bodies of information.

##### ID Attribute
###### As you will see when you come to look at CSS in the next section, giving an element a unique identity allows you to style it differently than any other instance of the same element on the page

```
HTML
<p id="pullquote">Every time I view the sea I feel 
 a calming sense of security, as if visiting my 
 ancestral home; I embark on a voyage of seeing.
</p>
```
##### Class Attribute
>Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will wantawayto identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.

##### Block Element
>Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements.
>Examples of block elements are <h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>

##### Inline Elements
>Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.
>Examples of inline elements are <a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>
##### Grouping Text & Elements Inline
><span>
>The <span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the <div>element. It is used to either:
 >1. Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable  element to differentiate it from its surrounding text
 >2. Contain a number of inline elements

<iframe>
>An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame


# what is javaScript
>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.
