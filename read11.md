# HTML Images


>The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.
    Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

    The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

    The <img> tag has two required attributes:
        - src- Specifies the path to the image
        - alt- Specifies an alternate text for the image


### Syntax
```
<img src="url" alt="alternatetext">        
```
### The src Attribute

> The required src attribute specifies the path (URL) to the image.

```
<img src="img_chania.jpg" alt="Flowers in Chania">
```

### The alt Attribute

> The required alt attribute provides an alternate text for an image, if the user for some reason cannot view      it (because of slow connection, an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader).
The value of the alt attribute should describe

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

> is the idea of 
    working out which terms people 
    are likely to enter into a search 
    engine to find your site and then 
    using these terms in the right 
    places on your site to increase 
    the chances that search engines 
    will show a link to your site in 
    their results.


## Analytics: Learning about your Visitors

>As soon as people start coming to your site, you can start analyzing 
    how they found it, what they were looking at and at what point they are 
    leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by 
    Google called Google Analytics

> Every time someone loads a 
    page of your site, the tracking 
    code sends data to the Google 
    servers where it is stored. 
    Google then provides a webbased interface that allows you 
    to see how visitors use your site
