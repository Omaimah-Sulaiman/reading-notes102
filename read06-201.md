# WHAT IS AN OBJECT? 
> Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.
## Accessing Object Properties
> You can access object properties in two ways:
 1- objectName.propertyName
 2-objectName["propertyName"]

## CREATINGÂ· OBJECTS USING LITERAL NOTATION
```
var hote l = { 
name: 'Quay', 
rooms: 40, 
booked : 25, 
checkAvailability: function() { 
return this.rooms - this.booked; 
} 
} ; 
JAVASCRIPT 
var el Name = document .getElementByld('hotelName'); 
elName.textContent =hotel .name; 
var elRooms = document.getElementByid{'rooms'); 
elRooms.textContent = hotel .checkAvailability();

# DOM :MODEL OF A WEB PAGE 
>As a browser loads a web page, it creates a model of that page. The model is called a DOM tree, and it is stored in the browsers' memory. It consists of four main types of nodes.

## DOM Tree
![dom](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--B2Ts1hyb--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/http://i67.tinypic.com/2nqegt2.jpg)

### ATTRIBUTE NODES 

>The opening tags of HTML elements can carry attributes and these are represented by attribute nodes in the DOM tree. Attribute nodes are not children of the element thar carries them; they are part of that element. Once you access an element, there are specific JavaScript methods and properties to read or change that element'sattributes. For example, it is common to change the values of cl ass attributes to trigger new CSS rules that affect their presentation.

### TEXT NODES
> Once you have accessed an element node, you can then reach the text within that element. This is stored in its own text node. Text nodes cannot have children. If an element contains text and another child element, the child 
element is not a child of the text node but rather a child of the containing element. (See the <em> element on the first <l i > item.) This illustrates how the text node is always a new branch of the DOM tree, and no further branches come off of it.

# WORKING WITH THE DOM TREE
> Accessing and updating the DOM tree involves two steps: 
    1: Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with. 
    2: Use its text content, child elements, and attributes. 

>Here are three common ways to select an individual element: 
- get El ement Byld ()
 >  Uses the value of an element's  id attribute (which should be unique within the page).  See p195 
-   querySe 1 ector () 
       > Uses a CSS selector, and returns  the first matching element.  See p202 
- You can also select individual elements by traversing from one  element to another within the DOM tree (see third column). 

>There are three common ways to select multiple elements.
- getElementsByClassName() 
   > Selects all elements that have a specific value for their cl ass  attribute.  
- getElementsByTagName() 
 > Selects all elements that have the specified tag name .. 
- querySelectorAll() 
   > Uses a CSS selector to select all  matching elements


# Example:

```
// ADDING ITEMS TO START AND ENO OF LIST 
var list = document .getEl ementsByTagName( ' ul ')[OJ;                         // Get the <u l> el ement 
// ADD NEW ITEM TO END OF LIST 
var newitemLast = document . createElement('li ');                              // Create element 
var newTextLast = document .createTextNode{'cream');                            // Create text node 
list.appendChild(newitemLast);                      // Add text node to element 
newitemLast.appendChild(newTextLast);                     // Add element end of list
                                                   
// ADD NEW ITEM START OF LIST 
var newitemFirst = document . createElement('li ') ;                     // Create element
var newTextFirst = document.createTextNode('kale');                     // Create text node 
newitemFirst.appendChild(newTextFirst);                                 // Add text node to element 
list.insertBefore(newitemFirst, list.firstChild);                       // Add element to list                    
                                 
                                
                                
                                 
   ```
