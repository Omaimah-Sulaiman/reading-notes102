# tables
>The <table> tag defines an HTML table.Each table row is defined with a <tr> tag. Each table header is defined with a <th> tag. Each table data/cell is defined with a <td> tag.By default, the text in <th> elements are bold and centered.By default, the text in <td> elements are regular and left-aligned.

```
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>

# Functions, Methods, and Objects

## Objects
> object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. A cup is an object  with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScripobjects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

## CREATE THE OBJECT, THEN ADD PROPERTIES & METHODS
```
LITERAL NOTATION 
var hotel = {} 
hotel .name= 'Quay'; 
hotel .rooms = 40; 
hotel.booked = 25; 
hotel.checkAvailabil ity =function() 
return this.rooms - this .booked; 
} ;

OBJECT CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION 
var hotel = new Object(); 
hotel.name = 'Quay'; 
hotel .rooms = 40; 
hotel . booked= 25; 
hotel.checkAvailability =function() 
return this .rooms - this.booked; 
} ;
```
## CREATING AN OBJECT WITH PROPERTIES & METHODS
```
var hotel = { 
name: 'Quay' , 
rooms: 40, 
booked: 25, 
checkAvailability: function() { 
return this.rooms - this .booked; 
} 
} ;

or

function Hotel(name, rooms, booked) { 
this.name = name; 
th is.rooms = rooms; 
this.booked = booked; 
this.checkAvailability = function() 
return this.rooms - this.booked; 
} ; 
var quayHotel =new Hotel('Quay', 40 , 25); 
var parkHotel =new Hotel('Park', 120, 77);
```

# Method
>A method is a function associated with an object, or, put differently, a method is a property of an object that is a function. Methods are defined the way normal functions are defined, except that they have to be assigned as the property of an object. See also method definitions for more details. An example is:

```
objectName.methodname = functionName;

var myObj = {
  myMethod: function(params) {
    // ...do something
  }

  // OR THIS WORKS TOO

  myOtherMethod(params) {
    // ...do something else
  }
};
```
>where objectName is an existing object, methodname is the name you are assigning to the method, and functionName is the name of the function.
