# What is REST?
>REST is an architectural style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia. REST is independent of any underlying protocol and is not necessarily tied to HTTP. However, most common REST API implementations use HTTP as the application protocol, and this guide focuses on designing REST APIs for HTTP.

>A primary advantage of REST over HTTP is that it uses open standards, and does not bind the implementation of the API or the client applications to any specific implementation. For example, a REST web service could be written in ASP.NET, and client applications can use any language or toolset that can generate HTTP requests and parse HTTP responses.

# Organize the API design around resources

>A resource doesn't have to be based on a single physical data item. For example, an order resource might be implemented internally as several tables in a relational database, but presented to the client as a single entity. Avoid creating APIs that simply mirror the internal structure of a database. The purpose of REST is to model entities and the operations that an application can perform on those entities. A client should not be exposed to the internal implementation.

# Define API operations in terms of HTTP methods

- GET retrieves a representation of the resource at the specified URI. The body of the response message contains the details of the requested resource.
- POST creates a new resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message provides the details of the new resource. Note that POST can also be used to trigger operations that don't actually create resources.
- PUT either creates or replaces the resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message specifies the resource to be created or updated.
- PATCH performs a partial update of a resource. The request body specifies the set of changes to apply to the resource.
