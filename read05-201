# Adding Images
> <img> chapter-05/adding-images.html HTML
    To add an image into the page 
    you need to use an <img>
    element. This is an empty 
    element (which means there is 
    no closing tag). It must carry the 
    following two attributes:
   > src
    This tells the browser where 
    it can find the image file. This 
    will usually be a relative URL 
    pointing to an image on your 
    own site. (Here you can see that 
    the images are in a child folder 
    called images â€” relative URLs 
    were covered on pages 83-84). 
  >  alt
    This provides a text description 
    of the image which describes the 
    image if you cannot see it.
  >  title
    You can also use the title
    attribute with the <img> element 
    to provide additional information 
    about the image. Most browsers 
    will display the content of this 
    attribute in a tootip when the 
    user hovers over the image.


```
<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of 
 quokka" width="600" height="450" />
 ```


# Color

> The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
 - rgb values
 - hex codes
 - color names
```
body {
background-color: rgb(200,200,200);}
h1 {
background-color: DarkCyan;}
h2 {
background-color: #ee3e80;}
p {
background-color: white;}
```
# TEXT 
### font-family
> The font-family property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to which a CSS rule applies.
The value of this property is the name of the typeface you want to use.
### font-size
> The font-size property enables you to specify a size for the font. There are several ways to specify the size of a font. 

```
body {
font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;
font-size: 12px;}
h1 {
font-size: 200%;}
h2 {
font-size: 1.3em;}
```
