# Basic JavaScript Instructions

## STATEMENTS 

>A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
>JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE JavaScript is case sensitive so hourNow means something different to **HourNow** or **HOURNOW**.
>STATEMENTS ARE INSTRUCTIONS AND EACH ONE STARTS ON A NEW LINE
>STATEMENTS CAN BE ORGANIZED INTO CODE BLOCKS 

## COMMENTS

>You should write comments to explain what your code does.
```
Multiline:
/* Th i s script displays a greeting to the user based upon the current time. 
It is an example from JavaScript & jQuer y book */
```
```
oneLine:
//......
```

## WHAT IS A VARIABLE?
>A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.

# Text
- Headings and paragraphs
  ```
    <h1>This is a Main Heading</h1>
    <h2>This is a Level 2 Heading</h2>
    <h3>This is a Level 3 Heading</h3>
    <h4>This is a Level 4 Heading</h4>
    <h5>This is a Level 5 Heading</h5>
    <h6>This is a Level 6 Heading</h6
  ``` 


 
- Bold, italic, emphasis
  ```
  <p>This is how we make a word appear <b>bold.</b>
  </p>
  <p>Inside a product description you might see some 
  <b>key features</b> in bold.</p>
```
- Structural and semantic markup
 >There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages â€” they are known as semantic markup
- <Strong>
 >The use of the <strong>element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis.By default, browsers will show the contents of a <strong>element in bold
- <em>
 >The <em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence.By default browsers will show the contents of an <em> element in italic

- <blockquote>
- <q>
- <abbr>
- <cite>


# CSS
>Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.CSS is easy to learn and understood, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.

```
p {
   
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
}
```














### Declare avariable

>var quantite ;
>to asign value 
> quantity = number or string or bolean

## Example 
> var name = 'j' => dataType string
>var name = 2 => dataType number


## ARRAYS 
>An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values
```
var colors; 
colors ['white', 'black', ' custom']; 
var el document.getElementByld('col ors'); 
el . textContent = col ors[O]; 
```
## VALU ES IN ARRAYS
>Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 

```
var col ors; 
colors= ['whi te ' , 
'black ' , 
' custom ']; 

INDEX   VALUE 
o      'white ' 
1      'bl ack' 
2      'custom'

```

# Loops

>You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. For example, the idea "Go five steps to the east" could be expressed this way as a loop:


```
Operator type	         Individual operators

member                          	. []
call / create instance          	() new
negation/increment           	! ~ - + ++ -- typeof void delete
multiply/divide              	* / %
addition/subtraction           	+ -
bitwise shift               	<< >> >>>
relational                  	< <= > >= in instanceof
equality                    	== != === !==
bitwise-and	                   &
bitwise-xor                     	^
bitwise-or	                    |
logical-and                  	&&
logical-or                   	||
conditional                  	?:
assignment             	= += -= *= /= %= <<= >>= >>>= &= ^= |= &&= ||= ??=
comma                        	,
```
## if statment
```
var pass = 50; 
var score = 75; 
var msg; 
II Pass mark 
II Current score 
II Message 
II Select message to write based on score 
if (score >= pass) { 
msg = 'Congratulations, you passed!'; 
} else { 
msg = 'Have another go!'; 
var el = document .getElementByld('answer'); 
el .textContent = msg; 
```
  ## switch 
  >A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value
```
switch (level) { 
case 'One ': 
title= 'Level 1 ' ; 
break; 
case 'Two': 
tit 1 e = ' Level 2 ' ; 
break; 
case ' Three' : 
title = 'Level 3' ; 
break ; 
default : 
title= 'Test'; 
break; }
```
