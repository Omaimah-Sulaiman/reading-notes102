# HTML Lits
>we have tow types:
 - Unorder list 
 - Order list
```
 An Unordered HTML List
    .Coffee
    .Tea
    .Milk
An Ordered HTML List
    1-Coffee
    2-Tea
    3-Milk
```

## Unordered HTML List
>An unordered list starts with the <ul> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default:
```
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>

```
## Ordered HTML List

>An ordered list starts with the <ol> tag. Each list item starts with the <li> tag.The list items will be marked with numbers by default:

```
<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>

```
# The CSS Box Model

>In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:
![box](https://codinglead.github.io/images/box-model.png)


#### Explanation of the different parts:

- Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
- Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
- Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
- Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent


# Control flow

>The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 
>For example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the script uses a conditional structure or if...else, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not:
```
if (field==empty) {
    promptUser();
} else {
    submitForm();
}
```
>A typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.For example, the above excerpt might be inside a function that runs when the user clicks the Submit button for the form. The function could also include a loop, which iterates through all of the fields in the form, checking each one in turn. Looking back at the code in the if and else sections, the lines promptUser and submitForm could also be calls to other functions in the script. As you can see, control structures can dictate complex flows of processing even with only a few lines of code.Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

### Switch Statemant :

>The switch statement executes a block of code depending on different cases.

>The switch statement is a part of JavaScript's "Conditional" Statements, which are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Use switch to select one of many blocks of code to be executed. This is the perfect solution for long, nested if/else statements.

>The switch statement evaluates an expression. The value of the expression is then compared with the values of each case in the structure. If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.

>The switch statement is often used together with a break or a default keyword (or both). These are both optional:

>The break keyword breaks out of the switch block. This will stop the execution of more execution of code and/or case testing inside the block. If break is omitted, the next code block in the switch statement is executed.

>The default keyword specifies some code to run if there is no case match. There can only be one default keyword in a switch. Although this is optional, it is recommended that you use it, as it takes care of unexpected cases.

```
switch(expression) {
  case n:
    code block
    break;
  case n:
    code block
    break;
  default:
    default code block
}

```
